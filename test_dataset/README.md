### Processed Output (`/processed/`)

#### `metadata/`
- **Purpose**: Rich JSON metadata files linking all related data
- **Format**: One JSON per source file with complete agentic analysis

#### `validated_midi/`
- **Purpose**: MIDI files that passed ‚â•85% accuracy validation
- **Format**: Standardized channel mapping for AI agents
- **Quality**: Only high-accuracy conversions retained

#### `agent_training_data/`
- **Purpose**: Per-channel agent training datasets
- **Format**: Instrument-specific behavior patterns and characteristics
- **Structure**: Organized by MIDI channel/instrument type

## üéõÔ∏è Curation Guidelines

### Audio File Selection Criteria:
1. **Diverse riddim types** - Cover main reggae subgenres
2. **Clear instrumentation** - Identifiable bass, drums, guitar, keys
3. **Quality recordings** - Good signal-to-noise ratio
4. **Moderate complexity** - Not too simple or overly complex
5. **Standard song structure** - Intro/verse/chorus sections identifiable

### MIDI File Selection Criteria:
1. **Instrument separation** - Each instrument on separate channel
2. **Realistic velocities** - Human-like dynamics, not all velocity 127
3. **Proper timing** - Not perfectly quantized unless digital riddim
4. **Complete arrangements** - Multiple instruments, not just melody
5. **Standard MIDI compliance** - Proper channel 10 drums, etc.

### Processing Efficiency Rules:
1. **Single-pass analysis** - Extract everything possible before deletion
2. **Cross-validation** - Use both audio and MIDI to validate each other
3. **Accuracy thresholds** - Only keep MIDI conversions ‚â•85% accurate
4. **Linked metadata** - Every file links to all related processing outputs
5. **Agent-ready output** - Standardized format for AI bandmate training

## ü§ñ AI-Bandmate Integration

### Channel Mapping Standard:
- **Ch 1**: Bass Guitar (Foundation Agent)
- **Ch 2**: Rhythm Guitar/Skank (Rhythm Agent)
- **Ch 3**: Lead Guitar (Lead Agent)
- **Ch 4**: Organ/Keys Comping (Harmonic Agent)
- **Ch 5**: Piano Chords (Chord Agent)
- **Ch 6**: Additional Percussion (Percussion Agent)
- **Ch 9**: Drums Kick/Snare (Drum Agent)
- **Ch 10**: Full Drum Kit (Kit Agent)
- **Ch 11**: Bass Synth (Sub-bass Agent)
- **Ch 12**: FX/Delays/Reverb (FX Agent)

### Agent Training Data:
Each processed file generates:
- Per-channel playing patterns
- Cross-instrument interaction patterns
- Spectrotone characteristics
- Timing/groove variations
- Dynamic response patterns
- Harmonic relationship patterns

## üìä Success Metrics

### Processing Efficiency:
- **Extraction Completeness**: 100% of available features extracted per pass
- **MIDI Accuracy**: ‚â•85% conversion accuracy before stem deletion
- **Processing Speed**: Full analysis in <5 minutes per audio file
- **Storage Optimization**: Audio stems deleted after successful MIDI validation

### AI Training Quality:
